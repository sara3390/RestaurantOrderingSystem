# RestaurantOrderingSystem

Made By: Sara Andonova – 63190354 

The “Online Restaurant Ordering System” aims to replace the conventional menu system which is time consuming and old fashioned. The system can be used from home to be able to track the availability of tables in real time, reserve them, as well as order in advance even before getting to the restaurant.
The main goal of the system is to remove waiting time at restaurants by allowing the customers to order food from home, even before they arrive at the restaurant. This will be done through the restaurant's website which will first offer a list of all the free tables. After selecting a table, the customers will be able to select the time that works best for them and will be provided the complete menu that the restaurant offers. Each menu item comes with a description of the item, ratings given by previous customers, a large image for better knowledge of the dish and the cost of the item.
When the order is finalized, the customers will be forwarded to a payment area and after a successful transaction they will be provided with a receipt which should be used at the restaurant to confirm a real reservation.
The restaurant will have the freedom to add or remove menu items whenever they choose from the system, as well as update existing items.
